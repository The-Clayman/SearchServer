Search Server

This Search Server (together with a [Search Client](https://github.com/The-Clayman/SearchClient)) simulates a Search Server who handles 1-n clients which send search queries and receives answers from server.
This project was done as part of an Operating Systems course's [assignment](http://www.elad-horev.org/Teaching/OS1/2016/Assignment.pdf).
